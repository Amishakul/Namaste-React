Class Based Component ðŸ¥ˆ

A functional component is a function which returns a piece of JSX.

A Class based component is a class which extends react.component and it has a render method which returns some piece of JSX, this JSX will be converted to html and will be displayed on the web page.

React.component is given to us by react.

React.component is a class inside react library

Loading a class based component on a web page means creating instance of a class.

when you create instance of a class, constructor is called.

so constructor is the best place to pass props and to create state variables in class based component.

In functional component behind the scenes the state variables are stored inside big state object, react does this behind the scenes.

Loading the component = mounting the component on to the web page.

When a class is created/made/instantiated a constructor is called,
so first constructor is called and then render method is called

ComponentDidMount is used to make API calls in class based component



Life Cycle of class-based component ðŸ¥ˆ

- Parent constructor
- Parent render
- FirstChild constructor
- FirstChild render
- SecondChild constructor
- SecondChild render

Reconcliation Algorithm

DOM UPDATED - IN A SINGLE BATCH
- FirstChild Component Did mount
- SecondChild Component Did mount
- Parent Component Did mount


StepsðŸ”´:

1. constructor is called
2. Render method is called
3. Then React will update the dom / Load the dom
4. Then ComponentDidMount is called

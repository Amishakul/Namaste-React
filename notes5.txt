A functional component is a function which returns a piece of JSX.

A Class based component is a class which extends react.component and it has a render method which returns some piece of JSX, this JSX will be converted to html and will be displayed on the web page.

React.component is given to us by react.

React.component is a class inside react library

Loading a class based component on a web page means creating instance of a class.

when you create instance of a class, constructor is called.

so constructor is the best place to pass props and to create state variables in class based component.

In functional component behind the scenes the state variables are stored inside big state object.

Monolith architecture: A whole big project which contains different components in it. (different components are combined in a single big project) components like: api, ui, authentication, sms services, etc

Microservices architecture: different small services for different jobs. i.e. each components are divided into an individual small project, and all these services combine together and forms a big app. for eg. services like: api, ui, authentication, sms services, etc. This concept is known as "Seperation of concern", "Single responsiblity principle". Each service has its own job no one is interferring in between each service

These small services(Microservices) interact with each other to form a big single project.

All these small services run on different specific ports. And all these small services can be written in any programming language.

React has one of the best render mechanism. It can render fast, n no of times

UseState is used to create state variables.

Shimmer UI helps you to show fake cards or fake UI design until the web app retrives actual data from the API.

CORS: CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It tells your browser whether it can load data from a different domain or not (different from top domain). For example, if your top domain is domain-a.com, and you have a resource within the page from domain-b.com, the CORS policy will tell your browser whether resources from domain-b.com should be loaded or not. In general, many websites have strict CORS policies that tell browsers to block loading their resources in different domains. But, in some situations, for example in web development or app testing, you may need to test something in cross domains. Therefore, the CORS policy needs to be enabled temporarily.

UseState is used to render(refresh) the page so that your component changes/ updates dynamically. Which can not be done using normal JS variables. Hence State variables(local variables) are used which is given to us by UseState.

whenever the state variable will change, react will re-render the component.

btnNameReact is a local variable and setBtnNameReact is acting as a function, so whenever this function will be called, btnNameReact variable will get updated with new value.

The whole header component will re-render not only just that login button. Header component is getting render but only the button changes.

Rendering means again calling out or triggering the component(refreshing)

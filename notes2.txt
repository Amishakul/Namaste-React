Functional component is made to reuse that function again and again in the code

Prop: Properties, we can use prop to pass the data dynamically to the component. Props are just normal arrguments to a function.
For eg. <RestaurantCard /> functional component is a prop now.

Prop is an js object. React will wrap up everything as an object and pass it as a prop.

ðŸ’¡-> So whenever we need to pass a dynamic data to a component we pass it as a prop

Another way of passing the prop: Destructing of objects

const RestaurantCard = ({resName, cuisine}) => {
    return (
        <h3>{resName}</h3>
        <h4>{cuisine}</h4>
    )
}

so here, const {resName, cuisine} = props;

Data comes from backend in the form of json

Config driven UI: Changing the carousal UI on the basis of backend data

Because of RestaurantCard reusable component we were able to pass dynamic props inside this component (reusable card)

Do not use index as a key in react instead use id

not using keys (not acceptable) <<<< index as a key <<<<<< unique id as key(best pratice)

In simple terms, screen is a tool provided by the testing library to help you easily find and interact with elements on the web page you are testing.

Think of it as a way to "look" at the page and find things on it.

Here's how it works:

When you write tests for your web app, you want to check if certain elements (like buttons, text, or inputs) are showing up or behaving as expected.
screen helps you "look" at the page where your app is rendered and find those elements.
For example:

screen.getByRole("button") is like asking "Hey, do I have a button on my page?". It goes and checks the page to find a button and gives it to you.
expect(loginButton).toBeInTheDocument() then says "I expect that button to be there". If the button is missing, the test will fail.
